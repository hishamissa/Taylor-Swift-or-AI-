# Who Said It? Taylor Swift or AI?

**Who Said It?** is a browser-based educational and experimental game that challenges users to distinguish between authentic Taylor Swift lyrics and those generated by artificial intelligence. By combining machine-generated text with curated lyrical data from a prominent contemporary artist, this project investigates the interpretability of artistic language and the current capabilities of generative models in mimicking a distinct authorial style.

## Project Description

This application presents the user with a series of single-line lyrics. Each lyric originates either from Taylor Swift’s official discography (spanning from her 2006 debut to her 2024 release, *The Tortured Poets Department*) or from an AI model trained to replicate her lyrical voice. The user must determine whether each line was authored by Swift or generated by AI. Upon submission of a guess, the system reveals the correct answer and, for real lyrics, provides the associated album name, release year, and track title. This project serves both as a web-based entertainment experience and as an exploratory exercise in machine learning literacy, creative computing, and frontend development.

## Current Features

- Interactive lyric quiz with over 400+ randomized lines per round, balanced between authentic and AI-generated lyrics
- Real-time user feedback with confirmation of correctness and additional metadata for real lyrics, including album name, year of release, and song title
- Controlled shuffling algorithm that ensures perceived randomness while mitigating statistically improbable streaks of similar content types
- Dynamic "Next" button to allow user-controlled progression through the quiz
- Integrated lyric datasets sourced from over 10,000 curated Taylor Swift lyric lines and 1,000+ AI-generated counterparts
- Modular file structure optimized for long-term scalability and feature development

## Technologies and Methodologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for interface development and game logic
- JSON data structures for efficient local storage and access to lyric corpora and track metadata
- A custom soft-randomization algorithm to manage fair content distribution without sacrificing natural randomness
- Procedural content generation using OpenAI's language models (e.g., GPT-4), guided by domain-specific prompting
- Local development with modular project directories, enabling clean separation of styles, scripts, data, and utilities

## Educational Objectives and Learning Outcomes

This project was developed with the intent to reinforce skills in full-stack web development, data management, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence application. The following key competencies were developed through its creation:

- Application of structured data parsing and transformation, including the generation and cleaning of large-scale lyric datasets
- Design and implementation of user-centric interaction flows with responsive pacing and feedback mechanisms
- Exploration of language generation capabilities through prompt engineering and the evaluation of stylistic coherence
- Integration of machine learning outputs into an accessible, educational interface suitable for public engagement
- Use of modular design patterns to facilitate future extensibility, testing, and deployment

Through the integration of creative and technical disciplines, this project exemplifies how computational tools can be used to engage with questions of authorship, imitation, and audience perception in the digital age.

## Planned Feature Enhancements

To support continued development, the following feature improvements are planned for implementation:

- Restart functionality for seamless replay without page reload
- Persistent scorekeeping, including correct/incorrect count and high score storage using `localStorage`
- Streak tracking and game statistics display at the end of each session
- Win/lose conditions and end-state messaging to provide game closure
- Full album art integration for authentic Taylor Swift lyrics
- Visual interface improvements, including animated transitions, theme variations, and accessibility enhancements
- Background audio and interactive sound effects to elevate user immersion
- Real-time lyric generation capabilities using OpenAI’s API, with filtering for coherence and style
- Public hosting of the game via GitHub Pages to allow public access and demonstration of the final product

## Deployment Plans

The project will be deployed through GitHub Pages, providing a publicly accessible and shareable interface for educational and entertainment purposes. The static frontend structure of the project allows for seamless deployment without backend dependencies.

This organization reflects a clear separation of concerns and supports modular updates as features are added or datasets are extended.

## Acknowledgements

Taylor Swift’s lyrical work provides the artistic foundation and inspiration for this project. The AI-generated content used here is produced solely for educational and experimental purposes. OpenAI’s GPT models were utilized for generating stylistically imitative lyrics under non-commercial use.

The database of Taylor Swift lyrics was provided by [sagesolar](https://github.com/sagesolar/Corpus-of-Taylor-Swift)

## License and Use

This project is intended for non-commercial, educational use. All AI-generated lyrics are original outputs derived from publicly accessible models, and all real lyric data is limited to brief single-line excerpts, in alignment with fair use principles.
